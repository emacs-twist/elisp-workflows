* Reusable GitHub Workflows for Emacs Lisp Projects
This is a collection of [[https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/reusing-workflows][reusable workflows]] for checking Emacs Lisp packages on GitHub Actions.
These workflows assumes your project contains ~flake.nix~ for rice.

With these workflows, you can automate the following checks with a very concise code:

- Run byte-compile with every Emacs version supporting your package.
- Run melpazoid (which is the official checker on MELPA).

** Installation
First follow the instruction in [[https://github.com/emacs-twist/rice-config][rice-config]] to add a ~flake.nix~ that conforms that the Rice API.
Then create a workflow file in ~.github/workflows~ directory of same repository.
** Example
You can add the following GitHub workflow file to your repository:

#+begin_src yaml
  name: Check Emacs Lisp

  on:
    pull_request:
      paths-ignore:
        - 'README.*'
    push:
      branches:
        - master
      paths-ignore:
        - 'README.*'

    workflow_dispatch:

  jobs:
    byte-compile:
      uses: emacs-twist/elisp-workflows/.github/workflows/byte-compile.yml@master
      with:
        rice-config: github:your-user/rice-config
        melpa: github:your-user/melpa/branch
        systems: github:nix-systems/x86_64-linux

    melpazoid:
      uses: emacs-twist/elisp-workflows/.github/workflows/melpazoid.yml@master
      with:
        rice-config: github:your-user/rice-config
        melpa: github:your-user/melpa/branch
#+end_src

This workflow runs byte-compile and melpazoid in parallel.
Byte-compile is run on every Emacs version supported by your package(s).
Melpazoid is run on the latest release version of Emacs.

If you have multiple packages in your repository, the checks are run for each package simultaneously.

Each workflow accepts the following input parameters:

- ~rice-config~ (optional) :: A [[https://nix.dev/manual/nix/latest/command-ref/new-cli/nix3-flake.html#flake-reference-attributes][flake reference URL]] to [[https://github.com/emacs-twist/rice-config][rice-config]]. This is optional, and the original repository will be used in that case, but it is recommended to fork the repository and add ~flake.lock~ to prevent from supply-chain attacks.
- ~melpa~ (optional) :: A [[https://nix.dev/manual/nix/latest/command-ref/new-cli/nix3-flake.html#flake-reference-attributes][flake reference URL]] to [[https://github.com/melpa/melpa][melpa]]. If your package is already on MELPA and no recipe change is involved, you can omit this setting. If your package is not available on MELPA yet, specify a branch that contains a recipe for the package, e.g. ~github:your-user/melpa/branch~. See the documentation of rice-config for details.

The following input parameter is accepted by ~byte-compile~, but not by ~melpazoid~:

- ~systems~ (optional) :: A [[https://nix.dev/manual/nix/latest/command-ref/new-cli/nix3-flake.html#flake-reference-attributes][flake reference URL]] to [[https://github.com/nix-systems][nix-systems]]. The CI matrix will be generated for these systems. The default value is [[https://github.com/nix-systems/default][github:nix-systems/default]], which means the checks will be run on both Mac and Linux. If you are not worried about cross-platform compatibility of your package, you can complete the CI earlier by setting this value to [[https://github.com/nix-systems/x86_64-linux][github:nix-systems/x86_64-linux]], because Nix is generally faster on Linux than on Mac especially on GitHub Actions.

- [[file:.github/workflows/byte-compile.yml]]
- [[file:.github/workflows/melpazoid.yml]]
